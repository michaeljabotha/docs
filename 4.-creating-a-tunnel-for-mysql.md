Then scroll down until you see the: Ports attribute with a blue underlined link

![](<.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2021-10-28 13-33-17 (1).png>)

Click on the blue link. This should open your default browser and try and open a web page. This web page will seem to be filled with nonsense. Please take note of the port after the localhost webaddress in the URL bar. For example 40843 in localhost:40843

You can now open mysql workbench and go to the connection view page

You can then right click on your existing DEV or DEV2 connection and say edit connection. You can then update the port with the previously noted port that we got in the browser.

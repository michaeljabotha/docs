You can use your cluster by starting from the cluster view. You can click on pods on the top bar or left bar to see the most important view for you.

You can select the correct namespace (namespace a fancy group containing all the neccesary resources for the DEV branch) by clicking on the namespace dropdown and selecting your dev workorder which should be prefixed by forcelink-. So if I would like to use DEV5227 for example I would select forcelink-dev5227 as seen in the below image

You can then see the appropriate pods for that namespace

You can for example inspect a pod (a service that runs) by clicking on it. A side panel will appear.
